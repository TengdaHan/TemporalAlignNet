# HTM-AA Dataset

**HTM-AA** means Auto-Aligned (AA) version of HowTo100M (HTM) dataset. It is an output of our Temporal Alignment Networks and a final goal of this project. 

HTM-AA is a large-scale **paired video-text** dataset, automatically obtained without any human annotation. 
In our paper Table 4, we show it can improve the backbone visual representation.

For a video from the HowTo100M dataset, HTM-AA provides: 
1. the visually alignable sentences taken from the YouTube ASR, 
2. their corresponding video timestamps (in second).
